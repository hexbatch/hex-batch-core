<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>pre-alpha-0.5.0</p>
<p>todo make this todo list a convention list/ and different task list in doxygen and perhaps put it in a md file </p><dl class="todo"><dt><b><a class="el" href="todo.html#_todo000005">Todo:</a></b></dt><dd>make doxygen know to look for .todo. in each folder under src to include for the lists</dd></dl>
<p>conventions Any tool needed by this project must be from a container, to make it easy for anyone to have a full environment up and running</p>
<p>todo all source file/folder, and test file/folder names use underscore and not dash ! Sad, I know todo all header and source file names have the folder path in the first part of their names, and the regular name as the last part, regular name is one word: example: hexbatch_api_main.h (will be a header at the top of the src/hexbatch/api) hexbatch_api_topsoil_fungly.cpp ( will be src/hexbatch/api/topsoil/hexbatch_api_topsoil_fungly.cpp ) Class names are same as file names, except snake case in place of underscores Namespaces are same as file names when needed the top namespace is hexbatch, the root of the sources</p>
<p>todo unit tests need to have .test. as the last part of their name, before the extension todo integrated tests (like when testing the library response in its api) are in the tests folder and tests for hexbatch are in that folder each integrated test should be in a folder of the api family, then the folder for the name of the api call, then named for what they try to do example: tests/hexbatch/user_accounts/get_default_sudo/get_guid.xpp</p>
<p>Getting the environment up and runnning !!!</p>
<p>docker</p>
<p>todo get headless doxygen running as unbuntu 20.04 todo get entire compile and emscripten toolchain up and running via docker containers, do not use local installed stuff!! todo get mongodb and sql-lite running as different containers todo update mysql,phpmysadmin and other older containers to use the latest and best todo add in git modules for parts of the website, run by the docker nginx, add the shell game and the front page</p>
<p>convention: all super secret passwords and certs will be in the .env , add in ability to store longer things (like ssl certs in a .env folder!) todo have a self signed ssl cert for localhost in the .env.example file and folder</p>
<p>Testing! todo add in a testing suit I like as a container and be able to hook it up to the automated tests</p>
<p>git commit chain todo when doing any sort of commit, rebuild the docs todo when ready to make a push to a protected branch [alpha,beta,release,master] and not just a mealy mouthed topic partial push, have tests run on source (unit + integrated) if any fail do not allow that push todo figure out a decent version path (do I just read it from the package.json when building and put it in a constant in the code , and use the same thing elewhere?) todo build the docker image of this library from current source and run integration tests on that also</p>
<p>git branches that are protected: alpha/*, beta/*, master, release/* the alpha, beta and release branches share the same version number as the name so alpha/1.0.1.x beta/1.0.1.x release/1.0.1.x</p>
<p>new alpha branch is spun off from master it has the current version of 3 plus a 0 for x , so 1.0.1.0 issues solved in alpha are done in topic branches, then put in master, and then new alpha branch is made with x bumped up so alpha/1.0.1.1. Old alpha branch of 1.0.1.0 is deleted off origin</p>
<p>once the current alpha branch looks stable enough a new beta branch is spun off that alpha, and has the same version of 4, so beta/1.0.1.1 when during beta testing issues are fixed in topics, they are pushed to master , and a new alpha branch is made with x (2 for example) bumped up again (and the older alpha removed) the new beta branch from the fixes in alpha branch is created (so now beta/1.0.1.2 is here and the older beta/1.0.1.1 is removed from origin) keep cycling like that until we get a beta that passes ok (so for example beta/1.0.1.23) when release is ready, the release branch is spun off from the beta branch , made release/1.0.1.23 and its distributed and the master branch has that tag now at the last commit The release branchâ€™s lifetime ends when its replaced by another release.</p>
<p>Rules to live by: only one alpha, beta, release branch exists at the same time the tags in master are made to mark where each alpha , beta and release was spun off at (with same name as branch, I think?) there is a constantly updated tag on master that points to the most current alpha, beta, and release and they are named just with that word commits to master must pass all unit tests, and integrated source tests, and have its docker image of the library for current source pass its integration tests</p>
<p>pre-alpha branches escape all of these rules, as development is too fast and chaotic for all this nonsense of well established work flow. Chaos rules! With one important exception: any commit to the master branch must pass tests and be able to build a container that passes tests. This means no updates to master until we have tests actually existing (or at least one!) and a container that actually works with the current version (such is) library</p>
<p>There can be multiple pre-alpha branches, but not more than three at any time. Also there needs to be a current tag called pre-alpha</p>
<p>build SELF Docker Image ! todo Have docker image for running the built library! in the tools/ one of the docker containers should be running this library , and the library should be the one just built todo it should use the source code OR download the branch used, if this is part of a repo, OR if should get the most recent stable version and build it and install it. Should use the same db credential variables for customization todo integeration tests should be run again inside the docker container as part of its build step, these are the tests associated with that version it built</p>
<p>todo CLion IDE settings : need to share build settings and to-do lists and spelling </p>
