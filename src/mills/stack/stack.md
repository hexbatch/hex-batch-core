# ≣ The stack

The stack allows a mill to be copied with a mixture of dynamic data (that will not affect the original mill) and static data

Stacks can have levels, levels are a copy of the stack already existing which may be set with a limit. 𝞴 instances for example, are only allowed to create one level per stack

When adding a level to the stack



*   The 📦 box copies its 𝚫 json from the last level
*   The 🚌 bus copies or updates the two reference, the count and flag from the last level
*   the level will use the ground level (original) ⚙ logic

When removing a level from the stack



*   the 🚌 bus tells of each dynamic data in both the bus and the boxes
*   dynamic rows are forgotten, and removed
*   static data is copied down to the previous stack


## ≣ Stack data storage



*   / 🏭 mill owner
    *   The mill this belongs to
*   / 🆔  the id-trait
    *   the unique trait generated for the ≣ stack
    *   each new stack layer gets a trait that inherits from the parent stack trait, which inherits from that 🏭 mill
*   / 🌐 world trait
    *   ≣ for stacks, there needs to be one world this belongs to
*   / parent trait
    *   ≣ for stacks, this is the parent pointer (can be null if this is the first stack for it)
*   / 𝝰 the alpha trait
    *   ≣ for stacks, this is the context
    *   if the stack is having a context, then can only interact with things that have this context, or things inside children contexts (if a B has a context of A, and then I make C have a context of B, then when D is put in the context of A, it can see C as they share the same context path
*   ⚑ operational flag
    *   ≣ for stacks, this shows if there can be dynamic data copying
    *    can set it to not copy back dynamic data to the parent
*   🛈 𝝰 counter
    *   ≣ for stacks, this is the number of child stacks allowed
    *   each level added this is decreased, when 0, cannot copy to stack any more
    *   example: this will be a 0 for 𝞴 instances
    *   also, for other things, a known trait can hold any limiting in a box for the mill

## ≣ 🚌 Bus Stack Data Storage

Only dynamic bus entries have another copy on the stack



*   / 🏭 mill owner
    *   The mill this ≣ 🚌 stack bus belongs to
*   / 🆔  the id-trait
    *   the unique trait generated for this ≣ 🚌 stack bus
    *   it will be a child of the stack bus trait in the previous level, or if first stack, then will be a child of the bus
*   / parent trait
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, this is the ≣ stack owner
*   / 𝝰 the alpha trait
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, this is the first trait
*   / 𝞫  the beta trait
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, this is the second trait
*   / 𝝮 the grouping trait
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, this is local collection trait
*   / ◎ the target trait
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, this is the 🚌 pointer to the original bus
*   🛈 𝝰 counter
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, is the current tag counter
*   🛈 𝞫 counter
    *   ≣ 🚌 for stacked buses, is the old tag counter

_note: if getting a known trait for standard info, that does not have an actual box, the ≣ stack  can override it if the 🏭 mill sets its 🚌 bus to be dynamic for that 📦 box_


## ≣ 📦 Box Stack Data Storage



*   / 🏭 mill owner
    *   The mill this ≣ 📦  stacked box belongs to
*   / 🆔  the id-trait
    *   the unique trait generated for this ≣ 📦 stacked box
    *   it will be a child of the stacked box trait in the previous level, or if first stack, then will be a child of the box
*   𝚫 json data
    *    ≣ 📦  for stacked boxes, this is there copy of the data of the box they use
*   💠 multipolygon for associating area
    *    ≣ 📦  for stacked boxes, stores overridden (their copy) area from their data
*   📍 location for a place in the world, or other
    *    ≣ 📦  for stacked boxes, stores overridden (their copy) point from their data
*   / parent trait
    *   ≣ 📦  for stacked boxes, this is the ≣ stack owner
*   / 𝞫  the beta trait
    *   ≣ 📦 ∫ for stacked boxes, stores overridden (their copy) selection
*   ⚑ operational flag
    *   ≣ 📦  for stacked boxes, can a descendant ≣ 📦 write to this ?
