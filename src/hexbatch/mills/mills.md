## Introduction

Mills are used to build shells, elements, interfaces, instances, semaphores, hooks, and promises. Basically, if something needs to store data, and do some logic; then they need to be from a mill. Once a mill is defined , it can crank out copies of the same things, if need be. Copies always go on a stack. Not everything needs copies, though. Some things defined by mills, like interfaces or gems or semaphores, only have one copy at a time.  Mills have three basic components

📦 Boxes are used to store data, and give details about the data.  Some of this data goes away, erased, never to be seen again, when some things finish up what they are doing. This type of data is called dynamic data here. Some data is shared between all copies generated by the one mill. This is called static data. And some data does not go away but is not shared, it is for that once copy only. This is called persistent data.

🚌 Buses do three things. They provide connections between the different things that make up a mill. They count tags used (pushed), or unused (popped). And they group things together into collections. They send signals to the logic when something has changed in the mill (or a copy on the stack)

⚙ Logic decides what to do based on the state of the bus. Logic is powered by tag collections, but can also make rules if a set of tags is missing too.  Logic can push or pop tags, to start other logic decisions. Logic can also turn things on and off. Logic knows how to wait on a semaphore

  ⚙ 🏁 Logic triggers listen for changes and decide if an action should be fired

  ⚙ ▶ Logic actions are what happens after a trigger is truthful , several actions can be on the same trigger





≣ Stacks are when mills have copies. These copies can have children of their own. When copied, the new copy is pushed down on the mill stack. Some of the data is shared with the parent, so an update to one is an update to all. Other data is just used inside the copy. These copies can be erased (popped off the stack)

≣ 📦 stacked boxes are boxes of mills put on the stack

≣ 🚌 stacked buses are buses of mills put on the stack

Mills can be organized, where there are children and parents. For example , a 🐚 shell has ♟ elements, and an 𝞴  interface has 💎 gems made up of shells

🏭 👪 mill inheritance allows inherited buses and boxes and logic to be altered or removed without copying over the unchanging data

🏭 📂  mill organization will set up the child parent relationships in the structures, and allow group membership from copied organizations to be altered without copying unchanging data


## 🌈 Segment : One ring to bind them all

All of the different components of a mill (box, bus, logic (operations and actions), stack, shells, elements, gems, mill relations and inheritance and overrides) all use the same data structure/db table. This is useful/needed for the organizing of these through selections later

The type of thing each segment is can be determined by the trait role, as every entry here has its own dedicated trait

each different ⚑ flag value, across all columns in this table, has a different integer representing it, so that it's easy to find, set,  mix and match different flags  and see what is valid

If a trait has write access to the id-trait, then that trait has permissions to write to any part of that segment, and can delete it. Segments who have id-traits that are system traits can only be deleted by other system traits

## 👪 Inheritance of 🏭 mills


### Inheritance

New mills can be made from multiple inheritance of other mills. While new copies of a mill are put on the stack, new mills are copies with nothing on the stack. If the new mill does not override the 📦 boxes, ⚙ logic, or 🚌  buses of the parent, then the parent can be used to select the child (or descendants)

Since there can be multiple inheritance, and ancestors can block selections by overriding parents. There is a table for inheritance in mills

In the data structures, simply create a new trait which will be the parent, and then add in the inheritance to the table below. There will be no new  buses, logic or boxes made. The descendants share any static data or settings. But, the descendants can create new boxes, logic and buses. If the new ones do not change the inherited ones (use the same traits in the sub structures and add or remove things that modify them), then this inheritance is called pure. However, pure descendants can add in unrelated things that do not impact the ancestor data or behaviors, and still be pure

Any child can override a bus,box, logic from an ancestor. If this has multiple inheritance which has two or more ancestors that share the same sub structure trait for a bus,box or logic, then one is randomly chosen, unless there is a mapping

Mills can be created to inherit and override other mills, and mill can have structures made out of other mills

A child mill will inherit all the sub mills without creating new entries, any changes to any gems inherited, for example, will create a entry in the mill organization structure, which flags what kind of change this is, and will automatically will mark the inheritance as not pure

To be considered a change of inherited mill organization, the relationship type must be the same as one of the types the parent uses. If the child uses a new type of relationship, then the changes do not pure state

## 📂 🏭 Grouping and Structures of Mills

 Usually , Mills do not operate alone, and are organized to work together. For example, interfaces have gems, shells have element lists, promises have handlers 

 Mills that do not inherit a structure from a parent make their own lists

## @ Tags and how they are used

Tags are used to store state. Symbolized by the @ symbol here, they are traits that are of type tag. A trait that is used as a tag cannot be used as anything else, but anything that can select that tag can use it for associative tagging, and anything that has permission to write to the bus trait , and can see a tag, can tag that bus with that tag

Tags can be pushed (add a row or count) or popped (remove a row or decrease the count) from a bus on a mill or stack.  When a tag is pushed onto a  trait, if there is no extra data in that push other than the tag.Then this is called a regular tag. And this kind of tag only has one entry on the bus. The number of times that tag is pushed - the number of times that tag is popped, is kept as the count on that bus entry.  The tag number can never get less than 0, no matter how many times it's popped, but can be any positive number based on how many times that it is pushed. A tag is present anytime its count is > 0.

👣 A associated tag can be assigned a trait to pair up with, regardless of permissions. If the associated tag is pushed twice with the same trait, then its count increases just like a regular tag that has no associated data. And that count is kept on the bus entry which has that pair recorded

Associated tags is how we store collections or groups

Tags can be related together in two ways.



*    Through relationship (all the tags of one thing can be descended from a certain tag, to treat it like a file structure, if needed)
*   And each tag can be given a group on the bus
    *   This group trait does not have to be related to anything
    *   If the same tag is pushed with a different group from last time, then that is a new bus entry, regardless if there is also associated data

    Selections can use tag relationships to filter out and focus only on some things. In addition, the caller of the selection can use its associated tags to pre-filter the selection

The general rule of thumb is that tags can be pushed and popped from a bus by anything that has permission, and that is how that mill or element state is maintained, if the logic on there will listen to the tags. If a tag is pushed or popped from a bus, and no logic rules are listening to that bus trait (or family as new buses have descendant traits related to the older ones), then the tag push or pop may help with selections done by other things later
