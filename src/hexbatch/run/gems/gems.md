# 💎 Gems, a mill that holds Shells

A / trait can be set as a gem, and create a mill which will simply hold shell mills 🐚 🏭

The gems never get to be on a stack, they are always mills

Gems by themselves do not have to do anything besides hold the shells.


## Advanced 💎 gem behavior

Gems can use their buses and logic and boxes to decide if they are compatible to the environment to release their shells. It's an all or nothing thing. Either all the shells work, or none do, in the gem.

It's also possible to use hooks to do anything when a gem decides to engage or not engage
