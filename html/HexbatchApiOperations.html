Calling the api</h2>
<p>When an api call is made, it’s executed the next turn. All api calls need a caller trait. And optionally can have a trait to receive the output.. If the api call has arguments those are supplied also</p>
<p>If the call is made outside of the library, then can specify how long to keep the results in the queue, then the gui associated with the call can be checked to see if the api call is done, and to get the results</p>
<p>Since API calls are not completed instantly, there is a way to track what is going on with them. Job guid is the guid of the api call</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">&gt;get-job-status job-guid</div>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md42"></a>
API Permissions</h2>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Every API call has its own trait. Which means api calls can be managed by the regular permission table. Since all API calls need a context, the permissions are calculated by the context being able to see, read and write to the trait of the API call it is making. A world can control which context do which api calls by adjusting the permissions</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>However, when making API calls from outside the library, the hosting software can pick literally any trait from that world to use as the API context (such as the root, or any sudo, or any other trait). An independent world depends on the hosting software to verify users interacting with that outer layer, which is beyond the control of the library here, and the hosting software assigns its own users at least one trait to use the library with. Perhaps the hosting software creates a new trait for each user, and then stores that trait guid in the user data.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>But a nested world only has the inside of a parent world to manage its access. Which means it is up to the parent world to figure out which traits inside of it can do which api calls to the nested world. It needs a standard and safe way to ask the nested world to create sudo traits, and then the parent can give the trait guids generated by the nested world to the parent’s traits that request them. And that access is calculated by how the parent traits have permission with the nested world id. When a nested world is installed in a world, it's given a world id that has the same permissions, by itself as a new user level trait id.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></p><ul>
<li>If a trait in the parent world can write to the nested world id, then that trait can request a sudo guid to do privileged api calls on the nested world. Even after having the correct guid to make calls with , only traits that have current permissions to write to the nested world id can make the sudo call</li>
<li>Any trait that can read the world id can call that nested world’s api to make a new user-level trait, so it can start to do regular api calls. Just like the sudo calls, the traits that have these user level guids can only call the nested world API if they currently have read access</li>
<li><p class="startli">And any trait in the parent world that cannot see the nested world trait id, cannot make any api calls, regardless if it has the correct sudo or user guids for the api context to the nested world</p>
<p class="startli">This is all enforced by the fact that a nested world’s api access is only done through the parent world. There is no way to directly call the api of the nested world. So, to handle calling the api of the nested world, each api call has an optional world id it can use to direct the call to the nested instead, and that is where the permission checks are done</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>When the access trait are generated, they have to be stored as strings (full name or guid) in the db as part of box 𝚫 json, instead of linked to by the primary key of the trait. Even though the nested world traits and segments are stored in the same db tables as the parent ones, traits and segments across different worlds cannot interact. The only way to transfer traits and segments across those world boundaries is to use the regular import and export apis</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md43"></a>
System Definitions</h2>
<p><b><b> Each api call is assigned a trait of its own, and the definition traits have their own family which follow the api call relationships. Because it's a trait, selections can filter for traits related to specific api calls. Each different param for an api trait also has its own trait. Api calls return json in key value pairs.Additionally, the api names, each of their param names, and each of the return keys can have aliases. The aliases allow both internationalization and allows defining short aliases on the command line.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Aliases have their own traits, which are the direct children of the traits they are aliases for. Each of the trait types: api, param, return, alias are not allowed in the 🌈 table at all. Instead, the api, returns, params, and aliases are defined in the api table</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Using the trait families, it's possible to walk the tree down to build up all the api</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>In addition to the API calls, there are several system defined traits, which always have a constant name and purpose, which are defined here. These trait types are just <em>system</em></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>The table also stores documentation in each language</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>

Mills as users calling the command line</h2>
<p><b><b> While any trait can call an api while operating inside an element and such, doing command lines requires using the guid of a user mill registered in the system. User mills can have boxes to store user data, although at this time there are done listed out</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md46"></a>
Synchronizing Segments Between World</h2>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Worlds can be set to sync on one or more selections at the same time. The selections can have overlap or be different. And the selections can be any range or complexity. Sister worlds sync with the root trait, for example, while nested worlds sharing the same host can select on traits or tags used to signal between the different worlds. To help with this, there are some api calls</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></p><ul>
<li>sync start &lt;selection&gt;<ul>
<li>Enable selection to be synced</li>
<li>returns the guid of the selection trait, use this as an argument for the other api</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sync stop &lt;🔤 🆔 &gt;<ul>
<li>Stops syncing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sync export<ul>
<li>⚑ of full will render the entire selection as json to be exported, with all data</li>
<li>⚑ of diff will render the patch of the changes since the last turn specified</li>
<li>🛈 turn number, to be used with the diff option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sync import<ul>
<li>send in the rendered json file from another worlds export</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sync trim<ul>
<li>trims older turns saved up, or can also be called when the last call to generate a diff for a turn is made</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>sync history<ul>
<li>gets information about a sync import done already</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>When the synchronization is made, it is a new segment so it has its own trait and guid, and can remember the selection for it, as well as its start turn. Each turn the sync has a child made which is used to link to the diff table</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Each sync export has its own hash, this is used as a handle when being imported</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md47"></a>
Syncing Diff (table)</h3>
<p><b><b> When synchronization is turned on, then turn by turn changes, done in this world, need to be tracked, and recorded.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></p><ul>
<li>new and removed **_traits_**</li>
<li>new , changed, removed **_segments_**</li>
<li>new, changed, and removed **_permissions_**</li>
</ul>
<p></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Data</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></p><ul>
<li>trait id of the synchronization<ul>
<li><b>The synchronization this belongs to, since each synchronization has its own child made each turn, then the turn this is for is linked through the sync trait id here</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>/ trait of what is tracked<ul>
<li><b>Each thing in the selection has its own row when changed, added, or removed</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>⚑ created, removed, changed<ul>
<li><b>If this trait is new to the selection this turn, its created, if the trait used to be in the selection last turn, its removed, else it's a change</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>𝚫 json of the changes<ul>
<li><b>if anything changes in the data table of the segment, permission or trait then its json of the changes is here</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p></b></b></p>
<p><b><b>When accepting incoming synchronization data. The new data is made into its own segment, before it's sorted out, and it will check to see if the same hash has been done before (it goes through and does the hash again, on the incoming json, and compares it to the json’s stated hash, to check)</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Then the changes are played back. This is done at the end of the turn, where the data is overwritten in a first come first server, if more than one sync file comes in, and has the data different, then that last data played is the final authority.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Only traits that would be in the selection are played, all the others are discarded. There is data to show how many things are discarded and overwritten</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
Importing and Exporting</h2>
<p><b><b> Sister worlds need to export and import stacks, when a stack is exported, then everything on that stack, and all its children, and all the stacks associated with it, if they are dependent on that, are removed from the data table in the segments and put into json form. The traits and permissions are not erased though. The export is just like, or very similar , to the syncing json.</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>When a world imports the stack, it should already have all the trait information through syncing, as sister worlds will always sync anything to do with traits. The importing world adds the json import on to its segment table</b></b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md49"></a>
Filterings Between Worlds</h2>
<p><b><b> The other way to get data from a world, other than syncing, is by using filters. Which map the information from a selection to a json data dump and returns it</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>The api to help with this filtering takes a selection, and the selection has an action to map certain things to a json key, and the json is assembled following the selection tree as its rendered per page. The selections above have the map functionality for this</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>The json is returned in string form, there is no file option to save it, that is up to the caller. Since this is a regular api function call, this can be used in library to pipe snapshots of arbitrary data relations, mapped to a structure something else understands, and the json data can be piped to logic, outside commands, etc</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>A world can be observed from the inside by having an instance inside of it, and then it regularly creates filters using tags or other things it recognizes, and those filters can go back through a remote call, thus giving a birds eye view, and other data. It's possible to navigate through a world like this</b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Example of a filter: a series of shapes and colors that map to tags and instances</b></b></p>
